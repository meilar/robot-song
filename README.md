## About this project
 
This web application takes a number from the user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with some themed substitutions made along the way.

## Known Issues

### Testing

The following tests were conducted to focus development and practice test-driven development.

#### Describe: testBeep(number)

Test: It should return true if the inputted number contains a 1.
Code: `testBeep(1771);`
Expected Output: `true`

Test: It should return false if the inputted number does not contain a 1.
Code: `testBeep(6776);`
Expected Output: `false`

**note:this function and strategy for testing numbers was deleted and refactored into the numTest function**

#### Describe: numTest(number)

Test: it should return an array when called.
Code: `numTest();`
Expected output: `[0, 0, 0]`

Test: It should increment a counter array based on the presence of 1, 2, or 3 in an input number.
Code: `numtest(123);`
Expected Output: `[1, 1, 1]`

Test: It should increment a counter array based on the presence of each 1, 2, or 3 in an input number.
Code: `numtest(11233);`
Expected Output: `[2, 1, 2]`

#### Describe: numSplit(number)

Test: It should split input number into an array of numbers.
Code: `numSplit(1771);`
Expected Output: `[1, 7, 7, 1]`

#### Describe: validation(number)

Test: It should return false if NaN is passed as an agrument.
Code: `validation(NaN);`
Expected Output: `false`

Test: It should return true if any other number is passed as an agrument.
Code: `validation(123);`
Expected Output: `true`

#### Describe: arrBuilder(inputNum)

Test: It should increment a counter equal to the value of inputNum.
code: `arrBuilder(10);`
Expected Output: console log: 10

Test: It should push each value between 1 and the inputNum into a new array called outputArr.
code: `arrBuilder(3);`
Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`

#### Describe: inputTransform(inputNum)

Test: It should create a new array by passing a value to arrBuilder then running that array through a for loop that pushes values into the new array.
code: `inputTransform(3)`
Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`

Test: it should run new array through a for each loop and return a numScore for each number.
Code `inputTransform(3)`
Expected output: [1, 0, 0] [0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1]

Test: it should replace numbers that inlcude a 1, 2, or 3 with a string.
code: `inputTransform(4);`
Expected output: [Beep, Boop, Won't You Be My Neighbor?, 4]
